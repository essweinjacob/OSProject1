# OSProject1

Outstanding Problems:
	- Some formatting might be weird
	- "warnings" saying that a thing may not work, but its fine because it does.

Problems Overcome:
	- Understanding c code for the most part.
	- How getopt worked
	- How to accept command line arguments
	- Implmentation of queue
	- Issue with traversing directories where when i was using chdir(), i would only be changing directory to relative path and not full path, so would try to switch into a directory that doesn't exist with in the directory it currently is in.
